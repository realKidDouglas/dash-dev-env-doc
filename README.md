# Notes about connecting to Dash and setting up different nodes

These are my experience dealing with Dash nodes making it easier for me to manage.

# Keeping overview
- At first of course we start with a Dash Desktop wallets on `mainnet` from https://www.dash.org/de/downloads/.

- Next we try out configurations for `testnet`, own `devnets` and `evonet` in [Dash Nets](net_configs.md).
	
- To keep track of wallets for different nets, here are my most used commands: 
	[Useful CLI Arguments and Commands](args_n_commands.md)
	
- Managing multiple wallets with one OS using bash aliases and how to import HD-wallets:
	[Managing wallets](managing_wallets.md)

Coming steps: 
- run devnet in docker.
- run docker mn testnet (mn-bootstrap)
- now "upgrade" to evonet (no longer needed since evonet is on testnet ;)
